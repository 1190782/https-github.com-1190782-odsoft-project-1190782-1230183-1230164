>Central City library needs a system to manage their library, readers and book lending. The library consists
of thousands of books (no other media formats are available) organized by genre (e.g., Science-fiction,
mistery, Law, Medicine, etc.) that the readers can lend, take home and return after a period (typically 15
days). When a reader doesn’t return a book on time a fine will be applied per day of delay
